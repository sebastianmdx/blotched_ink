            <p>
              Ruairidh (pronounced Ruri. Don’t worry, we didn’t get it the first
              time either). A name tells a story, it sets us apart and it
              becomes our mark. In Ruairidh's case his mark could’nt be clearer,
              because true to the Gaelic meaning of his name, he is our
              red-headed king. Brimming with ideas and a dream to work behind
              the camera, Ruairidh began his film making career putting together
              showreels for actors. Scrounging to get his own gear, he
              discovered a love for his work and a passion for film making. As
              he labored over notes and ideas, he found those very notes covered
              in stains and marks, and Blotched Ink was born. Two years later,
              Ruairidh leads a team of passionate filmmakers and storytellers
              from around the globe. Whether it showreels, short films,
              commercials, whatever it may be, we love a compelling narrative
              which engages our audiences across a variety of platforms.

              Coming from the land down under, Jack arrived in London to
              anything but mess about with spiders. After studying acting in
              Australia, he returned to the mother land to make his dreams a
              reality. An actor at heart, he thrives on bringing a creative
              vision to life. Jack has worked for brands such as IBM, Red Bull
              and Topdeck Travel and brings a wealth of creative and business
